### Asus Zenbook UX5406SA-PH79T Sound Driver Fix

I was tired of keeping this copied to my disk, and figured Ubuntu 25.10 has broken these sound drivers at least 3 times during various updates... so might as well make all the firmware available to everyone with the directions.

### Directions 
Download this entire repo.  Open each folder within it, and run the command in the adjacent fix.txt. It will put the missing firmware back where it should go on your installation.

Hope this helps!
